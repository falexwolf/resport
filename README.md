# resport: Make a research portfolio

A pile of scripts organically grown since 2010. It might never grow into maintainable software.

It uses Python and Bootstrap and I use it to build https://github.com/falexwolf/falexwolf.me.

If you think that a similar research portfolio generator could be of interest to a wider audience, please open an issue.

If enough people are interested this could be an occasion to make this a maintainable package.

Oh, and if you want the `resport` handle on PyPI, please also make an issue or ping me on LinkedIn or Twitter.
