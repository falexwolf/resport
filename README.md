# resport: Make a research portfolio

A pile of scripts organically grown since 2010. It might never grow into maintainable software.

It uses Python and Bootstrap and I use it to build https://github.com/falexwolf/falexwolf.me.

Oh, and if you want the `resport` handle on PyPI, please make an issue or ping me on LinkedIn or Twitter.
