# resport: Research portfolio

A simple Python-based research portfolio site generator: `pip install resport`.

For an example, see https://github.com/falexwolf/falexwolf.me.

Currently a pile of organically grown experimental code, for which I don't yet offer support. If you're interested in developing, please ping me!
